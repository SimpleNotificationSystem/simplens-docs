## Access

The dashboard provides a visual interface to manage notifications, debug issues, and configure plugins.

**URL:** http://localhost:3002 (default)

### Credentials

The dashboard uses secure authentication. Default credentials should be changed in production.

- **Username:** `admin` (or value of `ADMIN_USERNAME`)
- **Password:** *Configured in .env* (value of `ADMIN_PASSWORD`)

<Callout type="warn">
  Ensure `AUTH_SECRET` is set in your `.env` file to a secure random string (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 32`) for session security.
</Callout>

## Features

### Dashboard Home

The landing page provides a real-time health overview of your notification service.

- **Stats Grid:**
  - **Total Notifications:** Aggregate count of all events.
  - **Delivery Rate:** Percentage of successfully delivered notifications.
  - **Active Queues:** Count of Pending and Processing items.
  - **Alerts / Failed:** Indicators for items requiring attention.
- **Channel Cards:** Scrollable metrics for each active channel (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, etc.), showing traffic distribution.
- **Recent Activity:** A live feed of the latest notification events.

### Events Explorer

Navigate to **Events** to browse the complete history of notifications.

**Key Features:**
- **Search:** Filter by Request ID, Email, Phone, or User ID.
- **Filtering:**
  - **Status:** Pending, Processing, Delivered, Failed.
  - **Channel:** Filter by specific channel (e.g., "Email").
  - **Provider:** Filter by specific provider implementation.
- **Sorting:** Sort by Created or Updated date (Newest/Oldest).
- **Details:** Click the "Eye" icon to view full JSON payloads, delivery timelines, and provider responses.

### Failed Events

The **Failed** page is a dedicated workspace for troubleshooting.

- **Bulk Actions:** Select multiple failed notifications using checkboxes.
- **Retry:**
    - **Retry Selected:** Re-queue specific notifications.
    - **Bulk Retry:** Retry up to 100 failed notifications at once.
- **Error Analysis:** View precise error messages returned by providers or validation logic.

### System Alerts

The **Alerts** page captures operational anomalies that may not be simple failures.

**Alert Types:**
- **Ghost Delivery:** Notifications marked as delivered but missing provider confirmation.
- **Stuck Processing:** Notifications remaining in 'processing' state beyond the timeout threshold.
- **Orphaned Pending:** Items stuck in 'pending' without being picked up by workers.

**Resolution Options:**
1. **Retry:** Reset the notification to 'pending' for immediate reprocessing.
2. **Retry with Warning:** Retry but append a warning flag (useful for debugging recursion).
3. **Bulk Resolution:** Resolve up to 100 alerts simultaneously, with optional warning flags.

## Troubleshooting

### Login Issues
If you cannot log in or experience redirect loops:
1. Verify `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`.
2. Ensure `AUTH_SECRET` is set.
3. Check `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` if running behind a proxy or in local development.
4. Clear browser cookies.

### No Data / Stats
If the dashboard is empty:
1. Verify `MONGO_URI` in the dashboard's `.env` matches the API server.
2. Ensure the API server is writing to the same database.
3. Check dashboard logs: `docker-compose logs dashboard`.
