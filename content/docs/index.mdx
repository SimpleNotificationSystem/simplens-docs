## What is SimpleNS?

SimpleNS (**Simple Notification System**) solves the notification infrastructure problem by providing a robust, scalable, and extensible foundation for multi-channel notification delivery. Unlike cloud-based notification services that lock you into proprietary APIs and pricing models, SimpleNS runs entirely in your infrastructure, giving you complete control.

### Core Philosophy

<Callout type="info" title="Orchestration, not delivery">
SimpleNS handles the complex orchestration logic (retries, rate limiting, crash recovery) while plugins handle the simple delivery logic.
</Callout>

- **Plugin-based architecture**: Swap notification providers without changing application code
- **Self-hosted**: Run on your infrastructure, maintain data sovereignty
- **Production-ready**: Built-in observability, horizontal scaling, and fault tolerance

## Key Features

<Cards>
  <Card title="🔌 Plugin-Based Delivery">
    Delegate sending to any provider plugin. Install community plugins or build your own using the SimpleNS SDK.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔄 Exponential Backoff Retries">
    Automatic retry with increasing delays for failed deliveries. Configurable retry limits and backoff strategies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🛡️ Crash Recovery">
    Recovery service detects orphaned and stuck notifications, creates alerts, and enables manual intervention.
  </Card>
  <Card title="⏰ Scheduled Delivery">
    Queue notifications for future delivery using Redis-backed delay queues. Perfect for reminders and campaigns.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📈 Horizontal Scaling">
    Scale processors independently per channel. Add more workers as your volume grows without downtime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📡 Multi-Channel Support">
    Send notifications across multiple channels (Email, WhatsApp, SMS, Push) in a single API request.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🚦 Rate Limiting">
    Per-provider token bucket algorithm prevents hitting provider rate limits while maximizing throughput.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔔 Webhook Callbacks">
    Real-time delivery status updates sent to your application via webhooks. Track every notification's journey.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📊 Admin Dashboard">
    Modern Next.js dashboard for monitoring, searching, retrying failed notifications, and managing alerts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📋 Observability">
    Centralized logging with Grafana + Loki integration. Query and visualize logs across all services.
  </Card>

## Why SimpleNS?

<div className="overflow-x-auto">

| Problem | SimpleNS Solution |
|---------|------------------|
| Locked into a single notification provider | Plugin architecture — swap providers without code changes |
| Notifications fail silently | Exponential backoff retries with configurable limits |
| Crashes leave messages stuck | Crash recovery service detects & rescues orphaned notifications |
| Single point of failure | Horizontally scalable workers and processors |
| Complex scheduling logic | Built-in scheduled delivery with Redis-backed queues |
| Different APIs for each channel | Unified API for all notification channels |

## Architecture Overview

SimpleNS is built on a modern, event-driven architecture:

<Callout type="tip" title="Core Services">
- **API Server**: REST API for notification ingestion
- **Background Worker**: Outbox pattern for reliable message publishing
- **Unified Processor**: Plugin-based delivery with rate limiting and retries
- **Delayed Processor**: Scheduled notification handling
- **Recovery Service**: Detects and recovers stuck notifications
- **Admin Dashboard**: Web-based monitoring and management
</Callout>

**Infrastructure:**
- MongoDB for persistent storage
- Kafka for event streaming
- Redis for caching and delay queues
- Loki + Grafana for logging and visualization

<Callout type="note">
