The **SimpleNS MCP Server** connects your favorite AI assistants (Codex, Antigravity, VS Code) directly to your SimpleNS instance. By exposing the core engine as a set of tools, it allows you to send notifications to the recipients using natural language prompts. No individual scripts for varying content fields and schema.

## The Core Pain Point Solved

**Problem**: interacting with a complex notification system usually requires context-switching and manual effort:

-   **Schema Guesswork**: "Does the SMS plugin need `phone` or `mobile`?" usually means checking external docs or code. (`list_plugins`)
-   **Blind Debugging**: "Why did that email fail?" requires digging through dashboard logs or running database queries. (`find_failures`)
-   **Manual Remediation**: Retrying a batch of failed notifications often involves writing a one-off script or manually updating database records. (`retry_failure`)
-   **Opaque Health**: Checking if the system is healthy (e.g., ghost deliveries, stuck processing) typically requires a dedicated ops dashboard. (`list_alerts`)

**Solution**: The **SimpleNS MCP Server** exposes the entire notification engine as a set of performant, natural-language-accessible tools.
