The MCP server exposes the following capabilities to connected AI clients. Ensure your frontend documentation lists these so users know what they can do.

## Tools (Functions)

| Tool Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`send_notification`** | Send a single notification via any configured channel (email, sms, etc.). |
| **`send_batch_notification`** | Send the same content to multiple recipients efficiently. |
| **`list_plugins`** | Discover installed channels and their required fields (e.g., "Does 'sms' need a 'phone_number' or 'mobile'?"). |
| **`find_failures`** | Find failed notifications by channel, date range, or search term. Useful for debugging specific issues. |
| **`retry_failure`** | Re-queue a failed notification for immediate retry. Can be combined with `find_failures` for bulk retries. |
| **`list_alerts`** | View system-level alerts (ghost deliveries, stuck processing issues). |
| **`resolve_alert`** | Acknowledge and dismiss system alerts. |

## Resources (Data)

| Resource URI | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`simplens://schema/notification`** | The live JSON schema for single notification requests. |
